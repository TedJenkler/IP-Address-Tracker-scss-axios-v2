## Overview

### The Challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My Process

### Built With

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A frontend build tool for fast development with a modern workflow.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - For advanced styling and creating flexible, maintainable stylesheets.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - For making HTTP requests and handling data fetching.

### What I Learned

During this project, I gained more experience in the following areas:

- **SCSS:** Enhanced understanding of SCSS features like mixins, maps, variables, and responsive design.
- **Axios:** Improved skills in making HTTP requests and managing async data fetching.
- **Custom Hooks:** Developed and utilized custom React hooks for better code organization and reusability.

### Continued Development

- Plan to further improve responsiveness.
- Implement a feature to prompt users for their own API key or introduce a paywall when the default API key runs out of tokens.

### Useful Resources

- [SCSS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - For comprehensive details on SCSS syntax and features.
- [Axios Documentation](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - For guidance on making HTTP requests and handling responses with Axios.
- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) - For understanding and configuring Vite as a build tool and development server.
